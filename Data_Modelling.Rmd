#### What Have I Left Out of the Data Sets:

I still have both full data sets for both years (2015-2016 and 2009-2010) but for the 2015-2016 data set there are 5474 and for the 2009-2010 data set there are 1371 missing values. When I remove the 'Don't Know' responses, there are 45 missing values in the 2015-2016 data set and there are 42 missing values in the 2009-2010 data set.

In my Reduced Data Sets:

+ Removing Don't Know responses
+ Removing NA values
+ Removing Refused responses (only 2) from smoking variable (2015-2016 Reduced Data)

So if I use the reduced data sets (removing the don't know responses), for 2015-2016 data I will have 4622 observations and for 2009-2010 data I will have 5128 observations.


#### Logistic Regression

##### All Data 2015-2016

```{r, results='hide'}
all_dat <- all_dat %>% filter(Hypertension != "Don't know") %>% droplevels()
all_dat$Hypertension <-ifelse(all_dat$Hypertension == "Yes", 1 ,0)
all_dat$Hypertension %>% table
log_reg_all_dat <- glm(Hypertension ~ ., data = all_dat, family = binomial())
summary(log_reg_all_dat)
```

```{r}
coefficients(log_reg_all_dat) %>% exp() %>% round(digits = 6)
```

+ Not Smoking

#### Key findings:

+ Salt regardless of frequency intake seems to decrease the odds of Hypertension
+ Variables that increase the odds of hypertension include: being female, a unit increase in age, race (especially non-hispanic black), not taking insulin, a unit increase in BMI, no physical activity and not drinking 12 alcoholic drinks a year (2009-2010 data only).
+ variables that decrease the odds of hypertension include: not smoking, not having diabetes, having borderline diabetes, not having chronic kidney disease, not drinking 12 alcoholic drinks a year (2015-2016 data only) and the use of salt in food prep.
+ Potassium seems to have an equally likely odds ratios of hypertension.
