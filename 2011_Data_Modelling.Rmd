#### **Interpretation:**
+ The odds of having hypertension if you're a female is expected to decrease by roughly 9%. 

+ For a one unit increase in age you would expect your odds of having hypertension to increase by roughly 6%.

+ When you move from American Mexican race to Other Hispanic, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 26%.

+ When you move from American Mexican race to Non-Hispanic White, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 33%.

+ When you move from American Mexican race to Non-Hispanic Black, the odds of having hypertension is expected to be roughly 2.21 times higher.

+ When you move from American Mexican race to Other Race including multi-racial, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 31%.

+ When you move from not smoking to smoking, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 24%.

+ When you move from having not diabetes to having diabetes, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 84%.

+ When you move from having not diabetes to borderline having diabetes, the odds of having hypertension is expected to be roughly 2.45 times higher.

+ When you move from taking not insulin to taking insulin, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 18%.

+ When you move from having chronic kidney disease to not having chronic kidney disease, the odds of having hypertension is expected to be roughly 2.86 times higher.

+ For a one unit increase in BMI you would expect your odds of having hypertension to increase by roughly 8%. 

+ When you move from not being physically active to being physically active, the odds of having hypertension decreases by roughly 10%.

+ When you move from drinking at least 12 alcoholic drinks in a year to not, you would expect your odds to have no change.

+ When you move from never using salt to rarely, the odds of having hypertension decreases by roughly 13%.

+ When you move from never using salt to occasionally, the odds of having hypertension increases by roughly 5%.

+ When you move from never using rarely to very often, you would expect your odds to have no change.

+ For a one unit increase in potassium you would expect your odds of having hypertension to have no change.


**Variables that increases the odds of Hypertension **

+ 1 Unit Increase in Age
+ Gender
+ Smoking 
+ Having Diabetes
+ Having Borderline Diabetes
+ Taking Insulin
+ Having Chronic Kidney Disease
+ 1 Unit Increase in BMI
+ Drinking At Least 12 Alcoholic Drink in a Year
