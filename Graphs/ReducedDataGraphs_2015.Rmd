ggplot(hyp1) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x= Age, y = Hypertension)) + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Age", y = "Hypertension") + coord_flip()
#hypertension seems to be affecting older people in both genders


ggplot(hyp1) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x= Age, y = Hypertension)) + facet_wrap(~Race) + labs(x="Age", y = "Hypertension") + coord_flip()
#in all ethnic groups hypertension seems to be affecting older people

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = Smoking, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + xlab("Smoking") + labs(fill= "Hypertension")
#in both cases where people smoke or do not smoke, the proportion of people that do not have hypertension is higher than those who do have it

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = Diabetes, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Diabetes") + labs(fill="Hypertension")
#it seems as though hypertension is more common for people who do not have diabetes, however for those that do have diabetes, there is a higher proportion of people who have hypertension

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = Insulin, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Insulin Intake") + labs(fill="Hypertension")
#it appears that hypertension is more common for people who are not taking insulin

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = KidneyF, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Kidney Failure") + labs(fill="Hypertension")
#it seems as though hypertension is more common for people who do not have kidney disease


ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(x = BMI, y = Hypertension)) + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="BMI", y = "Hypertension") + coord_flip()
#there is a big overlap between the median BMI value for both male and females that both have heard from a doctor that they have hypertension and those that have not

ggplot(hyp1) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = PhysActivity, fill = Hypertension), position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Physical Activity", y = "Hypertension") 
#It is obvious that people that do not exercise weekly have a higher proportion of hypertension cases among men and women.

ggplot(hyp1) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Alcohol, fill = Hypertension), position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Alcohol", y = "Hypertension") 
#For both men and women with hypertension, it is clear that those who have had 12 alcoholic drinks in a year do have a higher proportion of hypertension cases.

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_bar(aes(x = Salt, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Salt",fill="Hypertension")
# it appears that the number of hypertension cases rise as the level of salt added to a meal increases. There is a clear difference for females with hypertension, that there are more cases for when salt used very often compared to never.

ggplot(hyp1) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(x = Potassium, y = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Potassium", y ="Hypertension") + coord_flip()
