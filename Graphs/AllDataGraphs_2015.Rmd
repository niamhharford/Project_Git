#in both cases where people smoke or do not smoke, the proportion of people that do not have hypertension is higher than those who do have it

#it seems as though hypertension is more common for people who do not have diabetes, however for those that do have diabetes, there is a higher proportion of people who have hypertension

      geom_bar(aes(x = Insulin, fill = Hypertension),position = "dodge") + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="Insulin Intake") + labs(fill="Hypertension")
#it appears that hypertension is more common for people who are not taking insulin

ggplot(all_dat) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(x = BMI, y = Hypertension)) + facet_wrap(~Gender) + labs(x="BMI", y = "Hypertension") + coord_flip()
#there is a big overlap between the median BMI value for both male and females that both have heard from a doctor that they have hypertension and those that have not
