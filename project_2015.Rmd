#### Check the number of observaions in each data set when NAs removed

```{r}
nrow(all_dat)
#5474
all_dat1 <- na.omit(all_dat)
nrow(all_dat1)
#4720
```


```{r}
nrow(hyp)
#4922
hyp1 <- na.omit(hyp)
nrow(hyp1)
#4628
```


There seems to be no major difference between the two datasets (hyp, with levels altered and all_dat) when I omit the NA values


```{r, eval=FALSE}
#Save the file locally
save(hyp1, file = "hyp1.RData")
load("hyp1.RData")
```

```{r}
glimpse(hyp1)
```
